ls aldt- What does this do and why does Sven like it?
ls lists the non-hidden contents of the directory. With -a, it will list all (including hidden) files. -l produces long form, which provides further information concerning the directory and files within. -d lists only the directory itself, and not the contents of that folder. -t displays last time of modification (sorts if there are multiple folders).

The command is nice because it displays owner of the folder, location, number of files in targetted folder, and last time of modification.

1.There are no words that start with the sequence "cie", using "\<cie.*\>" as the targetstring.

I found 3585 words have a c, any number of characters, an i, any number of characters, and an e.

2. ls /etc/*.conf -a > ~/foo.txt -r

3.history 25

4.find /etc/ -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d | wc -l
OR
ls -d /etc/*/ | wc -l
Both commands give me the same number of counted directories.

5.head /usr/share/dict/american-english -n 10000 | tail -n 6
Displays words 10000-10005
Merck's | Mercuries | Mercurochrome | Mercurochrome's | Mercury | Mercury's

6. d) *log*

7.Using "od -c WANIP.BAT" indicates that the lines are terminated with "\r".
Byte 0x19A location is the character "F". This can be identified using the command "od -Ax -c WANIP.BAT".

8.find . -type f -name "*yourSubstringHere*" to start from current directory, replace "." with "~" for home or "/" for root. Should throw a sudo at the beginning if also wanting to check in hidden folders.
